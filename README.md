# Student Engineer Frontend Challenge - Part 2 - Mercedesz Hohmann

## Creating an autocomplete component

While I was developing the autocomplete component I used an existing API called [PunkApi](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) which can give back different types of beers. I played around with it a little to make it similar to the one at the exercise. I got the following output after I run my code.

After that test phase, I implemented the API of this task in the code.

To run the code in the browser, I used the **npm start** command.
